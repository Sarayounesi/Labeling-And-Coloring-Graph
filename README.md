This repository contains solutions for the assignment focused on analyzing directed graphs and detecting communities within them.

Assignment Tasks
1. 
Input Files
•  The dataset is provided in two Excel files: one for nodes and one for edges.
2. 
Problem Description

Step 1: Graph Construction and Analysis
•  a. Construct the Directed Graph: Create a directed graph from the input data.

•  b. Statistical Information: Provide statistical information about the graph.

•  c. Centrality Measures: Report and analyze centrality measures for the nodes, identifying the top 5 nodes for each measure.

Step 2: Network Metrics and Analysis
•  Use various network metrics such as centrality, degree distribution, clustering coefficient, etc., to identify the most important nodes in the graph and provide an analysis.

Step 3: Graph Coloring and Community Detection
•  Color the graph based on node labels, ensuring nodes with the same label have the same color.

•  Analyze the colored graph and report interesting findings.

•  Detect and report communities within the graph.

•  Discuss whether community detection methods can classify nodes based on their labels.

Step 4: Disease Spread Simulation
•  Consider nodes with label 1L as infected.

•  Identify nodes with the highest probability of infection among nodes with unknown labels.

Step 5: Label Prediction
•  Use three different strategies to predict labels for nodes with unknown labels.

•  Enter the predicted labels in the Excel file and provide an analysis of the predictions.
